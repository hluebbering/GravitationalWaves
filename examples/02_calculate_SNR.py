# Calculate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gravitational waveform from a given binary merger


# Import data of a synthetic gravitational waveform generated using gravitational wave functions
# (demonstrated in example 01), and the FINDCHIRP trace data for the corresponding waveform. The example waveform is included in this repository, but the FINDCHIRP data files are not included in Github for file size reasons and can instead be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12TYxYKtBL1iuFHG_ySFhS12Aqv4JHGOr
